In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the Board for productive discussion and vote. Board members are expected to monitor the board mail lists to address time critical issues or continue discussions between board meetings. Board members should plan on attending at least EuroLLVM or the US LLVM Developers\u0026rsquo; Meeting. In addition to the regular meeting, board members are expected to participate with and drive efforts aligned with the mission and three programs above. Officers of the Board (Secretary, Treasurer, President) have additional duties and time commitments.\nThe current 2020-2022 LLVM Foundation Board of Directors:\n Kit Barton Kristof Beyls Mike Edwards (Treasurer) Hal Finkel Cyndy Ishida Anton Korobeynikov Tanya Lattner (President) Chris Lattner Tom Stellard (Secretary)  "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/branch-rename/','title':"Branch Renaming",'content':"Renaming Default Branch to \u0026lsquo;Main\u0026rsquo; Many tech communities, including GitHub and Git, have moved away from term “master branch” and replaced it with “main branch” in an effort to remove unnecessary references to slavery and use more inclusive terms. This was also discussed on the LLVM-dev mailing list and there was strong consensus from LLVM Developers’ that the LLVM Project should also rename our master branch as well. Now that an industry standard name has been selected by GitHub, the LLVM Project can begin the renaming process of the default branch to “main”.\nThis change will occur at 06:00GMT on Monday December 7, 2020 (time is GMT, please adjust for your local timezone).\nTo make this as easy as possible we plan to do the following prior to November 20, 2020:\n Create a new branch named \u0026lsquo;test-main\u0026rsquo; on the llvm-project repository  This branch will be read-only except for the LLVMBOT account Setup a GitHub action to mirror commits from \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; to ‘test-main\u0026rsquo; automatically Allow the configuration to soak for a few days to ensure everything works   Create a new branch named “main” on the llvm-project repository  This branch will be readonly initially Reuse the previous Github Action to mirror master to main This configuration will stay in place until cut over takes place on Dec. 7    On December 7, 2020:\n We will lock the master branch and change it to be readonly (with the exception of llvmbot) Switch the GitHub action to mirror commits from the new main branch back to the old master branch Make a few test commits to ensure the GitHub action is functioning as expected Open the main branch to commits from community members In parallel we will begin to work through the rest of the llvm organization repositories to update branch names as well We will update the developer policy to reflect the change in workflow  On January 28th, 2021:\n We will remove the ‘master’ branch from all repositories in the llvm organization  As we work towards December 7, 2020 we are going to set up a test of this system on a fork of the llvm-project in order to simulate the cut over. If we encounter any issues we will update the community on llvm-dev. We expect the llvm-project repository to be unavailable to developers for approximately 1 hour while the switch is made. Lockout will occur promptly at 06:00GMT on the 7th. Certainly if we finish sooner, we will update llvm-dev to let everyone know the repository is available for use once again.\nInstructions It was noted on the mailing list it might be helpful to include some basic instructions for anyone needing assistance with migrating to the new \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch. Here are two examples of steps one might take to accomplish this task:\nIn my local llvm-project directory:\n$ git fetch origin $ git checkout origin/main -b main  When you are ready to remove your local \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch run:\n$ git branch -d master  Here is an alternative approach provided by Mehdi Amini\n# if not already on the master branch $ git checkout master # Rename the branch locally $ git branch -m main # Update the tracking so that `git pull`/`git push` lookup the remote main $ git branch -u origin/main  Status Project status updates and news will be kept up to date and shared on this webpage. Please refer to this page to find the most up to date information.\nAs of 2020.11.12  Following discussion on llvm-dev, we have reached a decision to rename the default branch for llvm-project to \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo;  https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2020-June/142445.html   Tom Stellard is working through testing the GitHub actions used to keep branches in sync We anticipate having the new \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch created and syncing with \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; by November 20th  As of 2020.12.02  We have completed testing of the use of the llvmbot account to keep test-main branch in sync with the master branch We have dropped the test-main branch and have created the permanent main branch LLVMBOT is now keeping main in sync with master Unless any major issues are encountered in the next few days, we are on track to swap the default branch to main on December 7 as expected  As of 2020.12.07  We have updated the llvm-project repository to use the \u0026lsquo;main\u0026rsquo; branch by default We have corrected issues with the commit mail-list integration The \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch is now in read-only mode and will remain so until January 28th, 2021 We are beginning to work through documentation and other projects in the llvm org to get them updated as well  As of 2021.01.11  We are working through the remaining repositories in the LLVM GitHub organization llvm-lnt \u0026amp; llvm-testsuite were updated to use main today We have sent emails out to other repository owners to enlist their assitance with renaming We still look good to have this effort wrapped up by the 28th of this month  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':""});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/finance/','title':"Public Documents",'content':"LLVM Foundation Financial Documents This section contains all the Monthly and Annual Financial Reports published by the Foundation.\nMonthly Financial Reports  2020 ...

The high level goals of the relicensing effort are to:\n Encourage ongoing contributions to LLVM by preserving a low barrier to entry for contributors. Protect users of LLVM code by providing explicit patent protection in the license. Protect contributors to the LLVM project by explicitly scoping their patent contributions with this license. Eliminate the schism between runtime libraries and the rest of the compiler that makes it difficult to move code between them. Ensure that LLVM runtime libraries may be used by other open source and proprietary compilers.  This project involves sensitive legal issues and has been a multi-year effort. The primary public discussions have included these mailing list threads:\n October 19, 2015: Initial license draft proposal. September 12, 2016: Second license draft, resolving GPL2 compatibility concerns. April 17, 2017: Third license draft, which resolved concern about use of LLVM runtimes with proprietary toolchains. August 7, 2017: LLVM Developer Policy wording.  Beyond that, these topics have also been discussed by, and include contributions from, over a dozen lawyers and key LLVM contributors, and have been discussed informally with hundreds of people in the LLVM Developer Meeting BoFs. The effort has been overseen by Heather Meeker, who is the LLVM Foundation’s legal counsel. If you have questions or concerns about the content of this document, please email the llvm-dev mailing list or the LLVM Foundation Board depending on the sensitivity of your email.\nStatus and Documents At this point, we have achieved community consensus on:\n The goals of the relicensing effort. License Full Name: \u0026ldquo;Apache 2.0 with LLVM Exception\u0026rdquo;  SPDX License Identifier: \u0026ldquo;Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception\u0026rdquo; The license text itself. This is the expected LICENSE.TXT file. The revised LLVM developer policy patch.  We also have worked with our legal counsel to build several more boring pieces:\n A new top-of-file header block that is minimal and includes the relevant and important information about the new license. An individual agreement to relicense and a form to collect information necessary for completing the relicensing. A corporate agreement to relicense that is available for companies to sign and has begun to be distributed to some of the known and/or large contributors.  We currently plan to install the new developer policy and add the new license in January 2019 after the LLVM 8.0 release has branched.\nOnce that is done, we will still need need to:\n Enact a process for getting 100% of existing code relicensed with the above agreements or rewrite/remove the code. Drop the old license when the entire codebase is covered under the new license.  New File Header The new file header will be:\n//===-- file/name - File description ----------------------------\\*- C++ -\\*-===// // // Part of the LLVM Project, under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. // See https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt for license information. // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception // //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//  Some notable aspects of the new header:\n There is no explicit copyright notice \u0026ndash; these had little value and tended to not be maintained. It is designed to be as compact and minimalist as possible while having the critical information: that it is part of LLVM, what license it is under, where to find that license, and the machine-scrapable SPDX markup to help people doing license audits.  Individual Relicensing Agreement Individuals need to complete a web form that we will use to drive the relicensing process. Part of that form will prompt them with a DocuSign agreement that they can sign online to cover anything they personally contributed. It will also collect any companies or academic institutions that may own right to some of their contributions so that we can cover them with the corporate agreement below.\nWe do ask that individuals generally sign the individual agreement even if they think their contributions are probably covered by a corporate agreement. It will be fairly expensive for us to validate each case where an individual has not signed that *all* of their contributions are covered by a corporate agreement. The individual agreements let us not spend time and money on this by covering things either way. We think this is likely simpler and definitely less expensive. Still, we are leaving all of the options open.\nFeel free to send questions concerns about this to the Foundation mailing list.\nCorporate Relicensing Agreement Corporations may sign an agreement to relicense their contributions to LLVM under the new license with DocuSign. This is our preferred mechanism for collecting signatures. However, if your company requires it, you can print out this PDF of the agreement, sign it, scan it, and send the signed version as a PDF attachment to the LLVM Foundation Board. Further, if your company has a specific concern or issue with the agreement, please reach out to the the board and we\u0026rsquo;ll try to help.\nCompanies that have Signed:\n Expand ↕   AMD ARM Access Softek Andes Technology Apple Argonne National Laboratory Autodesk Azul Systems, Inc.

That said, we are dealing with a lot of unknowns, so while we believe the following schedule is achievable, this is not a guarantee:\n ~January 2019: Coincident with the final release branch date for LLVM 8.0, we will install the new developer policy. To ensure that all contributors have agreed to the terms of the new developer policy, we will recind commit access from all contributors who are not covered by a corporate or individual agreement at that point. We will develop a policy for affected contributors to regain commit access.  When these steps are done, all new contributions will be under the new license structure, and we expect that a significant amount of prior contributions will be relicensed under the new structure. At that point, we will scope and define the process for chasing down the long tail of prior contributions that are not covered and resolve them on a case-by-case basis.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/sponsors/','title':"Sponsors",'content':"Sponsors  Join our sponsors!\nDiamond Sponsors  Apple\n    QuIC\n    Platinum Sponsors  Google\n    Fastly\n    IBM\n    Gold Sponsors  ARM\n    Microsoft\n    Intel\n    Access Softek, Inc.\n     Synopsys\n    Facebook\n    Huawei\n    Sony Interactive Entertainment\n     Mentor\n       Corporate Supporters  MathWorks\n    Khronos Group\n    Reservoir Labs\n    Cockroach Labs\n    Texas Instruments\n     Xilinx\n    Mythic\n    MediaTek\n   Annapurna Labs    "});})();
