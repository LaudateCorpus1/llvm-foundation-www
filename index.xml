In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the Board for productive discussion and vote.</description></item><item><title>Branch Renaming</title><link>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/branch-rename/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/branch-rename/</guid><description>Renaming Default Branch to &amp;lsquo;Main&amp;rsquo; Many tech communities, including GitHub and Git, have moved away from the term “master branch” and replaced it with “main branch” in an effort to remove unnecessary references to slavery and use more inclusive terms. This was also discussed on the LLVM-dev mailing list and there was strong consensus from LLVM Developers’ that the LLVM Project should also rename our master branch as well. Now that an industry standard name has been selected by GitHub, the LLVM Project can begin the renaming process of the default branch to “main”.</description></item><item><title>Public Documents</title><link>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/finance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/finance/</guid><description>LLVM Foundation Financial Documents This section contains all the Monthly and Annual Financial Reports published by the Foundation.

The high level goals of the relicensing effort are to:
Encourage ongoing contributions to LLVM by preserving a low barrier to entry for contributors Protect users of LLVM code by providing explicit patent protection in the license Protect contributors to the LLVM project by explicitly scoping their patent contributions with this license Eliminate the schism between runtime libraries and the rest of the compiler that makes it difficult to move code between them Ensure that LLVM runtime libraries may be used by other open source and proprietary compilers This project involves sensitive legal issues and has been a multi-year effort.</description></item><item><title>Sponsors</title><link>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/sponsors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/sponsors/</guid><description>Sponsors Join our sponsors!
